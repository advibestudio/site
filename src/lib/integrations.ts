/**
 * MAKE.COM CONNECTION
 * -------------------
 * Every time someone submits the order form we send their details to a Make
 * "Custom webhook". Make then adds a row to Google Sheets and (if the person
 * gave an email) adds them to SendFox. See README.md, Part 6.
 *
 * The webhook address comes from VITE_MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL (in `.env` / GitHub Secrets).
 * If it's empty, nothing is sent (and nothing breaks).
